## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-step form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

    Complete each step of the sequence
    Go back to a previous step to update their selections
    See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
    View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
    Receive form validation messages if:
        A field has been missed
        The email address is not formatted correctly
        A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

The above screenshots show how the website looks on both mobile and desktop screens. The design is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes using the mobile-first approach and flexbox layout. The use of colors, typography, and layout elements is consistent throughout the website, giving it a professional and cohesive look.
